# blackjack_nn
Perceptron-based neural network learns to play blackjack


What is it?
-----------

This project is an experiment showing how a simpl—É neural network 
can automate the process of gambling (blackjack).

The program is written on python 3.6.9 in Google Colaboratory

It has code comments on RU

Rules
-----

Neural network plays blackjack by American rules:
   - dealer has 1 card open, 1 card closed
   - if dealer have 17, he stand.

I took them from wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack

But for the sake of simplicity, I left only actions
   - hit
   - stand

In a future, I will add other decisions, such as
   - double down
   - split
   - surrender


How it work? / Code structure
-----------------------------

1. Import libraries
   - numpy
   - tensorflow
   - matplotlib.pyplot
 
2. Generate data for machine learning 
   - def get_cards(): # deal cards for player and dealer
   - def get_data_from_cards(): # gives expected from nn output 

3. Building and training a neural network
~~~ python
model = Sequential([
          InputLayer((2,)),
          Dense(32, activation='relu'),
          Dense(1, activation='tanh')
])
~~~
~~~ python
model.compile(
    optimizer=Adam(0.001),
    loss='mean_squared_error',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
~~~
~~~ python
model.fit(X, Y, batch_size=32, epochs=25, verbose=0)
~~~
4. Using nn in games with auto dealer and virtual money balance
